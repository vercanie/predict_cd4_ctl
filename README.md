# Analysis of scRNAseq data from T cells in the PREDICT study
![Summary of the paper](./pics/predict_workflow.jpg) 

This repository contains an analysis of the single-cell RNA sequencing of gut biopsies and PBMC samples from children with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), 
disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) and healthy donors within the PREDICT study. The manuscript is in development, please see our previous publications:
